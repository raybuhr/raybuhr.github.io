      <description>Redesign Hugo Blogdown Lessons Learned Using Github Pages to Host   Redesign My previous blog design, as last blog post, used Rmarkdown (.Rmd) to create and build out the site. Rmarkdown is a really powerful way to communicate using the tools that R provides, but it is really slow and painful to rebuild every post each time you make a change to the site. Also, while you can always add custom css styling to your site and your Rmarkdown files, I found that it was difficult to not spend countless hours doing so and still end up with something I really liked.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, one of my fellow MIDS colleagues shared this article, Tech job postings are down 40% and nobody’s talking about it. As a data skeptic, I wondered if it was true.

 
Surely, this source had insight that I didn’t and maybe it was skewed to the job markets that company operates in, but I have really only seen more and more growth of tech jobs here in Chicago.</description>
