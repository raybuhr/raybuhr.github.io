      <description>A few weeks ago, one of my fellow MIDS colleagues shared this article, Tech job postings are down 40% and nobody’s talking about it. As a data skeptic, I wondered if it was true.

 
Surely, this source had insight that I didn’t and maybe it was skewed to the job markets that company operates in, but I have really only seen more and more growth of tech jobs here in Chicago.</description>
