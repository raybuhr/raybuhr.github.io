## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The R package rmarkdown can be used to [create websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) quickly and easily. If you are only interested in generating static content, which can include [interactive charts using javascript](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/), Github has free hosting through <https://pages.github.com>.

## Including Code and Graphs

By using a format like R Markdown, you can write stories along with creating plots, for example:

<br>

### Plane Engines Have Become More Powerful, Allowing More Passengers

<br>

```{r planes, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=filter(nycflights13::planes, engines == 2), 
       aes(x=year, y=seats)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

<br>

### Wind Speed and Temperature at Newark Liberty International Airport in 2013

<br>

```{r weather, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
df = nycflights13::weather %>%
    filter(wind_speed < 200 & origin == "EWR") %>% # remove outliers
    select(time_hour, wind_speed, temp) %>% 
    sample_n(365*2) # sample to reduce noise
    
dygraph(as.xts(x = df[,-1], order.by = df$time_hour)) %>%
    dyAxis("x", drawGrid = FALSE) %>%
    dyAxis("y", drawGrid = FALSE) %>%
    dyRangeSelector()
```

### Showing off the Diamonds dataset from ggplot2

<br>

```{r diamonds, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
datatable((diamonds %>% select(-x, -y, -z) %>% sample_n(500)))
```
