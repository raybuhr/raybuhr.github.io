The R package rmarkdown can be used to create websites quickly and easily. If you are only interested in generating static content, which can include interactive charts using javascript, Github has free hosting through https://pages.github.com.
 Including Code and Graphs By using a format like R Markdown, you can write stories along with creating plots, for example:</div>
